# AI Workflow Used in The Last Explorer

## Overview

This file explains how I used agentic AI tools during the development of **The Last Explorer**, a group C++ text adventure game. My goal was not to let AI generate the entire project blindly, but to use it as a productivity tool while still reviewing, testing, and controlling the final result carefully.

---

## Tools Used

During development, I used:

- **ChatGPT** for documenting project ideas, goals, and expected output
- **Trae AI** as the coding environment
- **Claude model** inside Trae AI for code generation and refinement

---

## Step 1: Defining the Project Clearly

Before using an AI coding tool, I first clarified the project idea in detail.

I used ChatGPT to help with:
- organizing the game concept
- describing the environments and story flow
- outlining what the gameplay should include
- identifying expected output and progression
- making the project explanation more structured and easier to communicate

This was important because better documentation led to better AI assistance later.

---

## Step 2: Using Documentation to Guide Trae AI

After documenting the project properly, I used that explanation to guide Trae AI.

Instead of vague requests, I tried to communicate:
- what the game should do
- how the progression should work
- what classes would be needed
- how the environments should connect
- what kind of logic the project should follow

This made the generated output more aligned with the actual project requirements.

---

## Step 3: Working Step by Step

One of the most important decisions was to avoid asking AI to build everything in one shot.

I worked in smaller steps such as:
- defining class responsibilities
- building environment logic
- refining game flow
- checking puzzle progression
- integrating player and inventory behavior

This approach helped me:
- keep control over the project
- understand the generated code better
- catch problems earlier
- refine features more effectively

From my experience, step-by-step prompting gave much better results than one large prompt.

---

## Step 4: Reviewing AI Output Carefully

I did not assume AI-generated code was automatically correct.

After each output, I reviewed:
- whether the logic matched the intended game flow
- whether the structure was reasonable
- whether the code aligned with the project requirements
- whether changes were needed before moving forward

This review process was necessary because AI can generate code quickly, but not always exactly as intended.

---

## Step 5: Testing and Validation

Testing remained essential throughout the project.

I validated AI-assisted code by checking:
- if it behaved as expected
- if the class relationships made sense
- if puzzle and item progression worked correctly
- if the implementation matched the intended gameplay

This project reinforced that AI can improve productivity, but **correctness still depends on human review and testing**.

---

## Development Challenge

One of the biggest difficulties I faced was that **Trae AI was available only on Windows**, while I wanted the project workflow and testing to align more closely with a **Linux-based C++ environment**.

Because of that, simultaneous generation and testing was less convenient. I had to adjust my workflow and IDE setup to validate code properly.

This highlighted the importance of:
- environment compatibility
- cross-platform testing
- checking AI-generated code in the actual target setup

---

## Why This Workflow Helped

Using agentic AI this way helped me:
- move faster from idea to implementation
- organize code structure more efficiently
- iterate on logic more quickly
- reduce time spent on repetitive coding patterns
- focus more on review and quality control

The biggest benefit came from using AI as an assistant, not a replacement for technical thinking.

---

## What I Learned

This project taught me that:

- clear documentation improves AI output quality
- smaller steps give better control
- human review is always necessary
- testing cannot be skipped
- AI is most effective when paired with developer oversight
- productivity gains are strongest when the developer stays actively involved

---

## Final Reflection

This project was not just about building a text adventure game. It was also a practical learning experience in how to use **agentic AI in software development** responsibly and effectively.

It showed me that a strong AI-assisted workflow involves:
- planning first
- documenting requirements clearly
- guiding the coding agent carefully
- reviewing outputs critically
- testing thoroughly
- and keeping ownership of the final result
